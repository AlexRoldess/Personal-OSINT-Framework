    <h1> Phase 2: Objectives Definition </h1>

    <h3> Why is this phase necessary? </h3>
    <p> 
      It is a critical phase that guides the entire course of the investigation. <br>
      It involves determining what information is intended to be obtained and why it is relevant to the research objectives. <br>
      This phase is considered due to the importance of being clear about what we are looking for to align the research with said objectives. <br>
    </p>

    <h3> What is this phase about? </h3>
    <p>
      The objectives definition phase includes tasks such as: <br>
      <ol>
        <li> 
          <h5> Establishing clear objectives </h5>
          <p> 
            It is essential to establish clear and specific objectives.
            This involves defining what type of data is required, such as email addresses, social media profiles, property records, organizational addiliations, or any other relevant information.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <h5> Creating a data collection plan </h5>
          <p> 
            With the objectives in mind, a detailed plan is developed for how the information will be collected. 
            This includes selecting appropriate data sources, determining the tools and methods, and planning the sequence of search and collection actions.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <h5> Evaluation of data availability and accessibility </h5>
          <p> 
            A preliminary evaluation is carried out to determine the availability and accessibility of the data.
            This may include a quick check of open data sources to understand what information is readily available and what data may require a deeper search effort.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <h5> Goal prioritization </h5>
          <p> 
            In some cases, there may be multiple objectives or pieces of information to be obtained.
            These are prioritized based on their relevance and urgency, which helps to better manage time and resources throughout the investigation.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <h5> Preparation for data analysis </h5>
          <p> 
            Finally, it is anticipated how the information will be organized and analyzed once collected
            (preparation of spreadsheets, databases or information management systems) to store and analyze the data effectively.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        <br>
        <strong> IMPORTANT : </strong>
        This is about making an initial plan. This plan is subject to modification during the investigation, depending on the data that is obtained.
