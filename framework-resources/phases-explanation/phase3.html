    <h1> Phase 3: Execution and Analysis </h1>

    <h3> Why is this phase necessary? </h3>
    <p> 
      The necessity of this phase is evident. In it, the active collection of data occurs and its evaluation is carried out to draw meaningful conclusions.
      It is the operational core of the investigation, where OSINT techniques and tools are applied to achieve the established objectives.
    </p>

    <h3> What is this phase about? </h3>
    <p>
      The execution and analysis phase includes tasks such as: <br>
      <ol>
        <li> 
          <h5> Active data collection </h5>
          <p> 
            Using the tools and methods defined, the systematic collection of information from open sources begins.
            Searches are made in online databases, social networks, public records, directories, forums, and other Internet resources relevant.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <h5> Use of automated tools </h5>
          <p> 
            Automated tools and specialized software are often used to perform advanced searches, web scraping and other tasks.
            This allows you to optimize the time and resources available.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <h5> Immediate provisional documentation </h5>
          <p> 
            As information is collected, it is carefully documented to ensure traceability and veracity of data.
            The objective is that, when doing the documentation phase, we simply have to synthesize what we have collected in these temporary reports.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <h5> Critical analysis of information </h5>
          <p> 
            With the information collected, a detailed analysis is carried out to identify patterns, correlations and anomalies.
            Analytical skills are used to discern between relevant and irrelevant information, and to interpret the meaning of the data.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <h5> Validation and verification </h5>
          <p> 
            These processes are carried out to confirm the authenticity of the information collected.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <h5> Inference and conclusion </h5>
          <p> 
            From the analysis, inferences are developed that allow conclusions to be drawn based on the evidence collected.
            The aim is to transform data into actionable intelligence that answers research questions.
