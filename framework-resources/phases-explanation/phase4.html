    <h1> Phase 4: Documentation </h1>

    <h3> Why is this phase necessary? </h3>
    <p> 
      After completing the collection of information, we must systematically record the evidence obtained and the conclusions drawn. <br>
      This phase guarantees that the investigative process is transparent, verifiable and useful for present and future purposes. <br>
    </p>

    <h3> What is this phase about? </h3>
    <p>
      The documentation phase includes tasks such as: <br>
      <ol>
        <li> 
          <h5> Record of evidence </h5>
          <p> 
            Every piece of information collected, whether raw data or analytical observation, must be meticulously documented.
            This includes the source of the information, the date and time of collection, and any relevant metadata.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <h5> Information organization </h5>
          <p> 
            The information collected is organized in a structured and logical format.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <h5> Analysis and synthesis of information </h5>
          <p> 
            A synthesis of the information collected is performed to highlight important findings and draw conclusions.
            This process often requires a review and comparative analysis of the evidence.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <h5> Report generation </h5>
          <p> 
            Detailed reports are prepared summarizing the research methodology, findings and conclusions.
            These reports must be clear, accurate, and provide sufficient detail.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <h5> Quality assurance </h5>
          <p> 
            A thorough review of all documentation is carried out to ensure its accuracy and completeness.
            This may include cross-checking of sources and data, as well as peer review within the research team.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
