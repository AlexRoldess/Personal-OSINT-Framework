    <h1> Phase 2: List of data types </h1>

    <h3> Why is this phase necessary? </h3>
    <p> 
      It is a fundamental stage that establishes the foundations for efficient and secure data collection. <br>
      This phase involves a series of critical steps designed to protect both the researcher and the integrity of the research. <br>
    </p>

    <h3> What is this phase about? </h3>
    <p>
      The preparation phase includes tasks such as: <br>
      <ol>
        <li> 
          <h5> Establishment of false or anonymous identities </h5>
          <p> 
            Digital identities not linked to the researcher must be created. This includes social media profiles, email addresses, and any other necessary identifiers.
            The purpose is to avoid leaving digital traces that could point to the researcher and to protect your true identity from possible retaliation or blocking during data collection.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <h5> Preparing virtual machines </h5>
          <p> 
            Virtual machines are simulated computing environments that provide an additional layer of isolation and security.
            By using them, you can operate in controlled environment that minimizes the risk of data contamination, and you have access to specific tools from other operating systems.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <h5> Installing secure and specialized browsers </h5>
          <p> 
            The use of browsers like TOR is essential, as they are designed to anonymize user activity and prevent online tracking, protecting the privacy and sensitivity of the research.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <h5> VPN configuration </h5>
          <p> 
            VPNs are services that encrypt a user's internet traffic and hide their real location, offering an additional level of anonymity and security.
            In this way, geographical restrictions can be avoided and the risk of exposure during data collection reduced.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <h5> Definition of security and privacy protocols </h5>
          <p> 
            Clear protocols are established to handle sensitive information securely and in accordance with relevant privacy laws.
            This includes procedures for secure data storage, password management, and handling of confidential information.  
          </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <h5> Review of legal and ethical aspects </h5>
          <p> 
            The laws and regulations on data collection and privacy in relevant jurisdictions should be reviewed.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <h5> Training and familiarization with OSINT tools </h5>
          <p> 
            The researcher must be trained in the use of techniques and tools. This involves becoming familiar with the research software, methods and any other tools.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
