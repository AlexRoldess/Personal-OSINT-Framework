The "osint-tools-installation.sh" script installs a variety of OSINT tools on Debian-based machines, such as Kali Linux.

In this way, there are three options:

1. If you have a Debian-based machine and want to conduct OSINT investigations from it, you can simply run the script on your machine.

2. If you don't have a Debian-based machine and want to set one up from scratch, you can download a VM with a Debian-based OS from official sources, such as Kali Linux. You can download it from here: [Kali for Virtual Machine](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines). After setting up the VM, you can proceed to run the script.

3. If you don't have a Debian-based machine and you want one specifically optimized for OSINT tasks, you can download the TraceLabs VM. It's a Kali VM that is incredibly optimized in resources and storage for OSINT. You can download it from its repository: [TraceLabs VM Releases](https://github.com/tracelabs/tlosint-vm/releases). After downloading the VM, you can run the script.

This way, you will have a Debian-based machine with multiple tools installed for conducting personal OSINT investigations.
