The "osint-tools-installation.sh" script installs a variety of OSINT tools 
on Debian-based machines, such as Kali Linux.

In this way, there are three options:

    1. That you have a Debian-based machine, and you want to do the OSINT 
    investigation from it. In this case, you would only have to run the 
    script on your machine.

    2. That you don't have a Debian-based machine, and you want to get one 
    from scratch. In this case, you can download a VM with a Debian-based 
    OS from the official pages, such as Kali Linux.

    The way to do it is in the following guide: 
    https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/install-virtualbox-guest-vm/

    Then you should just run the script.

    3. That you don't have a Debian-based machine, and tou want to get one
    specifically optimized for OSINT tasks. In this case, you can download
    the TraceLabs VM. It's a Kali VM incredibly optimized in resources and
    storage for OSINT.

    You can download it from its repository:
    https://github.com/tracelabs/tlosint-vm/releases

    Then you should just run the script.

This way, you will have a Debian-based machine with multiple tools 
installed for personal OSINT investigations.
