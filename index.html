    <h3> NOTES </h3>
    <p> Personal OSINT Framework focused on gathering information from free tools or resources. The intention is to help people find free OSINT resources. Some of the sites included might require registration or offer more data for money, but you should be able to get at least a portion of the available information for no cost. </p>
    <p> This Framework was originally created with an information security point of view. It is an adaptation of the general OSINT Framework, focused on personal OSINT. </p>
